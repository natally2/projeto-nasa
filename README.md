Did you know that during the pandemic the numbers of people with depression and anxiety increased by about 80% in less than a month?
We at POG present an exclusive platform for the exchange of time and knowledge between people, 
so that they do not feel alone and can feel useful.
The platform has machine learning applications which are trained using data sense obtained by NASA in order to map activity of interest.
